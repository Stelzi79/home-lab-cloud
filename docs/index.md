#Hostname:
	Hostnames are domains, where a domain is a hierarchical, dot-
  separated list of subdomains; for example, the machine "monet",
  in the "example" subdomain of the "com" domain would be
  represented as "monet.example.com".

       Each element of the hostname must be from 1 to 63 characters long
       and the entire hostname, including the dots, can be at most 253
       characters long.  Valid characters for hostnames are ASCII(7)
       letters from a to z, the digits from 0 to 9, and the hyphen (-).
       A hostname may not start with a hyphen.

       Hostnames are often used with network client and server programs,
       which must generally translate the name to an address for use.>)
